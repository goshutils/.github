# Security Policy

This is goshutils' [general security policy].
Each repository may have its own version or specific details, so be sure to also check if the project has a file at `.github/SECURITY.md`.

## Supported Versions

As long as I am actively maintaining a project, all versions are "supported", or at least, I'll do my best to provide as much help as a solo developer can offer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report a [security advisory] if you find any security issues or vulnerabilities.
